## Context

In 2018, I knew nothing about computer development and started [a training course to learn web developer](https://openclassrooms.com/fr/paths/48-developpeur-web-junior). There were several projects to hand in and defend in front of a jury. It was one of them.

## Project

My very first IT project ðŸŽ‰

The task was to integrate a web agency's website mockup.

### Mockup

  ![form section model](/assets/form_section_contact.png)

</details>

 ### Instructions

 The few technical prerequisites were as follows: 
 - the website had to fit on a single page with a menu that was always visible even when you moved around the page.
 - A map with a contact form (it doesn't have to be functional).
 - Responsive management with at least one breakpoint defined without using a framework (e.g. Bootstrap)
